    In Res-IRF 2.0, the share of single- and multi-family dwellings was held constant in both existing and new
    housing stocks, but at different levels; it therefore evolved in the total stock by a simple composition
    effect. These dynamics are now more precisely parameterized in Res-IRF 3.0 thanks to recent empirical
    work linking the increase in the share of multi-family housing in the total stock to the rate of growth of
    the total stock housing growth (Fisch et al., 2015).
    This relationship in particular reflects urbanization effects.
